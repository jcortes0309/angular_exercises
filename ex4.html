<!--
Hints
1. Study angular-examples/4-heads-tails.html game and angular-examples/7-guess-number-2.html.
2. Math.random() returns a random number between 0 and 1. It will return a number greater than 0.5 with a 50/50 chance.
3. Use a message property to display messages to the player in the event that the the player wins or loses.
